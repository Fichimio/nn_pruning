## BERT-base uncased model fine-tuned on SQuAD v1

This model is block sparse: the **linear** layers contains **{{"%.1f"|format(sparsity.block_sparse_density * 100)}}%** of the original weights.
{% if sparsity.ampere %}
Moreover, this model is Ampere sparse. That means that the non-zero blocks are themselves Ampere sparse, reducing the number of parameters, increasing speed, with a limited impact on precision.
{% endif %}

The model contains **{{"%.1f"|format(sparsity.global_density * 100)}}%** of the original weights **overall**.

The training use a modified version of Victor Sanh [Movement Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07683) method.

That means that with the [block-sparse](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch_block_sparse) runtime it ran **{{"%.2f"|format(performance.speedup)}}x** faster than an dense networks on the evaluation, at the price of some impact on the accuracy (see below).



This model was fine-tuned from the HuggingFace [BERT](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1423/) base uncased checkpoint on [SQuAD1.1](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer), and distilled from the equivalent model [csarron/bert-base-uncased-squad-v1](https://huggingface.co/csarron/bert-base-uncased-squad-v1).
This model is case-insensitive: it does not make a difference between english and English.

## Pruning details
A side-effect of the block pruning is that some of the attention heads are completely removed: {{sparsity.total_pruned_attention_heads}} heads were removed on a total of {{sparsity.total_attention_heads}} ({{"%.1f"|format(sparsity.total_pruned_attention_heads / sparsity.total_attention_heads * 100)}}%).

Here is a detailed view on how the remaining heads are distributed in the network after pruning.
